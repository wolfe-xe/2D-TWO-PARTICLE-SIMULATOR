# 2D Two Particle Simulator

This demonstrates realistic physics-based interactions between two particles in a 2D space. Utilizing SDL2 for rendering and SDL_ttf for text display, this project showcases gravity effects and accurate collision detection and response between particles and with window boundaries.

Features:

  >Real-time Simulation: Observe particles move and interact in real-time.
  >Gravity: Particles are affected by gravitational acceleration.
  >Collision Detection and Response: Particles collide with each other and bounce off window boundaries with realistic physics.
  >Text Rendering: Displays collision counts using SDL_ttf.

Future Implementations:

  >Additional Particles: Extend the simulation to handle multiple particles interacting in the same space.
  >Performance Optimization: Refactor and optimize the code for better performance and efficiency, especially with an increased number of particles.
  >Enhanced Physics: Implement more advanced physics features such as friction, particle attraction/repulsion, and variable mass.
  >User Interaction: Add controls for the user to interact with the simulation, such as adding/removing particles, adjusting gravity, or changing particle properties.
